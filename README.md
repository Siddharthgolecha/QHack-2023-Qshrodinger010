## The ARKS Representation

ARKS ( pronounced as "ARCS" ) is a new way of representing Quantum states that allows us to visualize different states for more than one Qudits ( Yes, you read it right. Qudits with d-ary states) and also visualize quantum entanglement. The ARKS representation draws its inspiration from Neural Network's representation.
